Blog website - Personal Portfolio.

This was my first attempt working with ReactJS to learn advanced front-end libraries and work along with them to enhance my
web-development skillsets. 

To surf the website, the below are the steps:
    1. Ensure you are in the "portfolio" directory.
    2. Ensure you are in powershell terminal, as ReactJS works with bash.
    3. Once all done, type in the terminal:
        "npm start"

        This should launch the web server, and automatically open your browser with the website.
